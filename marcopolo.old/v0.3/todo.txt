+ use Context

+ udpReadLoop
  + read from socket in a goroutine (so can respond to quit)
    -> should also permit us to clean up / simplify code (single select !?)

+ client func (q *query) doQueryLoopy
  // send serviceDef,
  q.serviceCh <- serviceDef
  .. this is blocking until client reads

+ replace log.Fatal() !
